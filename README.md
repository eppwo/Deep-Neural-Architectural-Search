# Deep-Neural-Architectural-Search
This repository contains the code used for the project in course 02456 Deep Learning at DTU.

The project compares a simple ResNet50 performance on labelled data (CIFAR-10 and MNIST) with the performance that can be obtained through a 
neural architecture search (NAS). The two scripts
