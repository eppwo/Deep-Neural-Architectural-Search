# Deep-Neural-Architectural-Search
This repository contains the code used for the project in course 02456 Deep Learning at DTU.

The project compares a simple ResNet50 performance on labelled data (CIFAR-10 and MNIST) with the performance that can be obtained through a 
neural architecture search (NAS). 

The two scripts with titles "Resnet50 for comparison..." contain a script that trains CIFAR-10 and MNIST data 
respectively using a simple ResNet50. 

The two scripts "NAS_CIFAR10" and "NAS_MNIST" contain the super-architecture search on the two labelled data sets. 

Running all four scripts will print out results.
